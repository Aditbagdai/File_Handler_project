        "Accurate and efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. However, traditional methods of handling product data may be cumbersome and prone to errors. They often involve manual entry and maintenance processes, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. By harnessing the capabilities of Python programming, we can develop a solution that automates tasks such as adding, reading, updating, and deleting product information. This streamlined approach not only enhances data accuracy and reliability but also improves operational efficiency.\n",

        "**CRUD** operations represent the four basic functions that are essential to interact with a database or a data storage system. The acronym CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations form the foundation of most applications that store and manipulate data. Understanding CRUD is crucial for developers working on web, software, and database applications. Here's a brief overview of each operation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Create**: This operation is used to add new records to a database. It involves inserting data into a database table or a data structure. For example, adding a new user to a user database is a Create operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Read**: The Read operation is used to retrieve or read data from a database. It involves querying the database to fetch information based on certain criteria. For example, fetching all the information about a product.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Update**: This operation is used to modify existing data in a database. It involves updating one or more fields of a database record. For example, changing a user's email address in a user database is an Update operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Delete**: The Delete operation is used to remove records from a database. It involves deleting one or more records from a database table. For example, removing a user from a user database is a Delete operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These operations are vital for managing data effectively in any application. They allow applications to perform basic data management tasks, ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and accessible.\n",

        "### Requirements\n",
        "- Define a function named `delete()` that deletes entries for a given SKU from sales data, product details, product descriptions dictionaries, and also deletes corresponding JSON and text files related to the product.\n",
        "- The function should accept four parameters:\n",
        "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data, with SKU as keys.\n",
        "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing product details, with SKU as keys.\n",
        "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions, with SKU as keys.\n",
        "  - `main_folder`: A string representing the location of the main folder containing subfolders for product details and product descriptions, where corresponding JSON and text files are stored.\n",
        "- The function begins by prompting the user to enter the SKU of the product they wish to delete.\n",
        "  - If the SKU does not exist in the `sales_data` dictionary, print a message indicating that the SKU was not found and exit the function early.\n",
        "- The function then proceeds to delete the entries for the specified SKU from the `sales_data`, `product_details`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries.\n",
        "- After successfully removing the entries from the dictionaries, the function attempts to delete the corresponding JSON file (containing product details) and text file (containing product descriptions) from the specified `main_folder`. It constructs the paths to these files based on the SKU and the folder structure.\n",
        "  - If the specified files exist, they are deleted, and a success message is printed.\n",
        "  - If a file does not exist, a message indicating that the file was not found is printed.\n",
        "- The function returns a tuple containing the updated `sales_data`, `product_details`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries.\n",
        "- Usage:\n",
        "  - The function is designed for cases where a product is to be completely removed from the system, including its sales records, details, descriptions, and associated files. It requires the current states of the `sales_data`, `product_details`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries and the path to the *main_folder* as inputs, and returns their updated states after the deletion.\n"

This function will integrate create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, allowing users to manage product information interactively from the command line. Your implementation should handle data loading from a specified directory, user input processing to select the desired operation, and data persistence upon exit. This exercise aims to reinforce skills in Python related to function definition, user input handling, conditional logic, and file I/O operations, encapsulating them within a practical application for data management.\n"

        "- The function performs the following tasks:\n",
        "  - Initially, it loads existing product data from files located within *main_folder* by calling a `load_data()` function. This step assumes that `load_data()` returns three dictionaries: `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions`, representing the current state of the product data.\n",
        "  - Displays a menu with options to create new product data, read existing data, update data, delete data, or exit the program.\n",
        "  - Based on the user's input, the function directs to the respective operation by calling other functions (`create()`, `read()`, `update()`, `delete()`) and passing the necessary parameters to them.\n",
        "    - For creating, reading, and updating operations, it uses the current state of `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` as arguments.\n",
        "    - For the delete operation, it also passes the *main_folder* path to specify where the files related to the deleted product should be removed from.\n",
        "  - Upon choosing to exit (option 5), it calls a *dump_data()* function to persist the latest state of the product data to files within the *main_folder* before exiting the program.\n",
        "- The function loops continuously, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until the exit option is selected.\n",
        "- The function ensures robust user interaction by handling invalid choices and guiding the user back to the menu options.\n",
        "- Usage:\n",
        "  - The function is designed as the central hub for a product data management system, providing a user-friendly command-line interface for performing CRUD operations on product data. It integrates file handling for data persistence, ensuring that changes are saved and can be reloaded in future sessions.\n"
